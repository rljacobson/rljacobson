*Ask me about what I‚Äôve been learning recently!*



## &#120139;he Philosophical

**Passion.** My favorite experiences are of solving problems nobody has ever solved before, finding the best known solutions to really hard problems, and learning new areas of math or cs that I didn't know about before‚Äîwhich I try to make a daily habit despite its affect on my technical book hoarding issue.

My experiences Mentoring‚Äîand being mentored‚Äîhave been among the most rewarding of my career. I cannot imagine working in a role in which these experiences were not present in some form or another, whether mentoring junior devs or sitting at the feet of other experts, or something I have not yet imagined.

**Skill Set.** My skills slice across traditional boundaries between job categories, by which I mean what I can bring to an organization is usually not  captured by a single narrow job description as one finds in typical job  listings. My graduate training is in an esoteric branch of pure  mathematics, and I have an undergraduate degree in computer science. I  never left computer science. As a professor at an undergraduate teaching institution, I studied machine learning and computer vision with  undergraduate research students. I simultaneously studied compilers and  the theory of programming languages in my own research time. 

By an  accident of history, this particular unusual skill set, as eclectic as it seems, just happens to be a mix that allows easy entry into the  problem spaces of society's most pressing challenges. That‚Äôs what I intend to do. I am moving to industry specifically to make a bigger impact with my skills and interests. Lately we have been working together on a  variety of projects related to the pandemic and the international  wildlife trade.

**My Next Role.** I have a very clear view of what my career is about. My vocation is to take a challenging problem, which is typically within mathematics or computer science or their application and often novel, learn the academic sub-fields relevant to the problem to near exhaustion, and produce a solution that is novel or improves on the state of the art. 

I am also interesting in mentorship, both as a mentor and a mentee. It is very important to me that I work in an environment where saying, "I don't know," is the norm rather than an admission of guilt. A mutually supportive and constructive environment produces better science, superior products, and happier employees. 

## Fun Stats

This is what Sourcerer.io says about my development directory. It is not entirely accurate. I am certain I have more C++ than reported, but I have never used DirectXTK.

**ONE of the following is a lie:**

1. I once got a thank-you letter from the United Nations.
2. I redesigned the TRS-80 using modern SMD components.
3. I almost got into a fight with [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.stephenwolfram.com/), but [Steven Pinker](https://stevenpinker.com/) intervened. We all remain good friends to this day.
4. I went out on a dinner date with [Lawrence Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig)'s graduate research assistant.
5. I went out on a dinner date with [Lawrence Lessig](https://www.lessig.org/).
6. I've worked with a lifelong friend of [Prince William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge), the second in line to the British throne (but I won‚Äôt tell you who).
